        <h1>An innovative European technical university</h1>
        <p><b>
        Since its founding in 1827, KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm has grown to become one of Europe’s leading technical and engineering universities, as well as a key centre of intellectual talent and innovation. We are Sweden’s largest technical research and learning institution and home to students, researchers and faculty from around the world dedicated to advancing knowledge.
        </b></p>
        <br>
        <h2>Versatile solutions to global challenges</h2>
        <div style="float:left;display:inline-block;">
           <p>
        KTH is working with industry and society in the pursuit of sustainable solutions to some of humanity’s greatest challenges: climate change, future energy supply, urbanisation and quality of life for the rapidly-growing elderly population. We are addressing these with world leading, high-impact research and education in natural sciences and all branches of engineering, as well as in architecture, industrial management, urban planning, history and philosophy. Almost two-thirds of the SEK 4 billion turnover relates to research.

        <p>
        Basic and applied research are performed side-by-side at KTH and interdisciplinary research is conducted in parallel with work in specific fields. This approach encourages versatile solutions and the innovative climate creates many opportunities to realise great ideas. Our educational programmes foster a new generation of engineers, architects, teachers and undergraduate engineers.
        </p>
        <p>
        KTH embraces academia and the public and private sectors working together. We are part of extensive international research collaborations and participate in a large number of educational exchange or joint programmes with universities and colleges in Europe, the U.S., Australia, Asia and Africa.
        </p>

        <h2>Working for a brighter, more sustainable tomorrow</h2>
        <div style="float:left;display:inline-block;">
            <p>
        Sweden is considered to be one of the most technologically innovative countries in the world and Stockholm is consistently ranked as one of world’s most entrepreneurial, innovative and attractive cities. KTH maintains close relationships with an expanding network of international companies and the industrial community in a number of fields and working and studying here provides access to this network.

        </div>
        <p>
        The five KTH campuses in Greater Stockholm, gather more than 13,000 full-time students, over 1,700 PhD students and approximately 3,600 full-time employees. The campuses are strategically located close to their areas of research and study, for example KTH Kista is situated in the middle of the Kista ICT hub, with some of the world’s leading Information and Communications Technology companies. One of our other campuses, KTH Flemingsberg, is located in one of Northern Europe’s leading medical technology centres for research and industrial activity.
        </p>
        <p>
        KTH will continue to focus on research and education for a brighter, more sustainable tomorrow. We will continuously assess the impact of our efforts in society and contribute with the intellectual resources of our students and researchers to create new approaches to some of the most critical challenges of our times.

        <h2>Stockholm: The university capital</h2>
        <p>
        The largest public sector universities in Stockholm – Karolinska Institutet, KTH Royal Institute of Technology and Stockholm University – complement each other and offer outstanding education and research environments, strengthening the capital region and playing a central role in development at national and international level.
        </p>
        <p>
        In collaboration the three universities offer a comprehensive university environment for research and education. More than 4,000 researchers and 47,000 students across all scientific fields have chosen one of the three renowned institutions.

          <h1 align="center">More than 175 years of excellence</h1>
          <h4>
            The origins of the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm – "Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan", KTH – go back to 1827, as the "Teknologiska Institutet" then began to offer education in technological subjects with a strong professional touch. Its education programme was meant to be "popular as well as practical", as the industrialization process of modern society was then getting under way; this called for a school that could meet the ever-increasing demand for engineers. Thus the educational focus of the new institute was set on applied technology, not on its scientific foundations.
          </h4>
          <p>
            Ten years earlier, in 1917, KTH had moved into its own, specially erected buildings in the northern part of central Stockholm. This is still the core of KTH´s main campus, even if our activities today include a number of other campuses all over the Stockholm provincial area. The housing areas of these are now comprising some 250,000 square metres in all.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consequently a mass of students did compete for placements here at KTH – the place of action, where things occurred! In the early 1950s Sweden´s first nuclear reactor was installed in a cellar in our campus area, while on the other side of the street, higher up, Sweden´s very first TV station went on the air! In short, public confidence in the blessings of technology was of a high order.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here at KTH about 20,000 people today are active as students – of every description and background, and of both sexes. The traditional picture of the KTH undergraduate as being a male seems to be a die-hard one, however, today´s development towards greater equality, and a number of KTH efforts to that very effect, have paid off handsomely. A lot of things have changed materially since 1921, when admission to the regular programmes at KTH first became available to everyone, irrespective of their sex.
